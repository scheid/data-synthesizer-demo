/*
 Sample Data Synthesizer Configuration Object

 This config object defines everything about how your data set will be created.


 to create calculated fields: if you want to generate a field based on some function of a raw field, then
    supply a function name after the field name value in the 'name' field, separated by a colon.
   for example, if you want to create a field value that is a hash of another field, you might do:

   name: 'myField:myHashingFunction',

   where, myHashingFunction takes a single argument that each field value will be passed into. your function
   should return the final value you want to use for that field. e.g.,:

   function myHashingFunction(val) {

      return makeHash(val);
   }


   The function should be either part of or visible to the data generation class at runtime. (or make function  part of config object?)
